2025-11-27 21:16:47,Toyota,0.9788,"Tacoma Versus Competition - Your Thoughts? I was hoping to get community thoughts on my new truck purchase. I'm in the market for a upper trim midsized truck and it's currently between the Taco/Ranger/Colorado, but leaning towards Ranger. I am pleasantly surprised the new Taco is being advertised on lots with substantial discounts like the Ranger. Midsized truck prices are out-of-control!

Hi everyone,
I lost both of my key fobs at the same time, and when I went to Toyota service to get replacements, the tech told me they would need to install a new ECU. He said that after they reprogram my truck, the new key fobs won’t work unless the ECU is replaced.

This sounds a bit odd to me, and I’ve never heard of anyone needing a whole new ECU just because key fobs were lost. Has anyone gone through this before? Is this actually a thing for certain Toyota models, or am I",https://reddit.com/r/Toyota/comments/1p7pmrb/toyota_said_i_need_a_new_ecu/
